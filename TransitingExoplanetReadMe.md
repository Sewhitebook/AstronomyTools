To use the transiting exoplanet code, replace the in_path line with the folder directory where your fits files are located.
The code assumes Las Cumbres Observatory style headers. If your files are not from there you may need to modify the header indices.
Calibration stars and initial model guesses are currently chosen manually. Automation of those will potentially come in the future.
Do not hesitate to email me at sewhitebook@ucsb.edu for assistance.
